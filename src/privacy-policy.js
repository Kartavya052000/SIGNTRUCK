        <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means. You may request such personal information up to twice annually, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> You have the right to delete personal information that you have provided by or that we have obtained about you.

        <li><strong>Right to opt out:</strong> You have the right to opt out of the processing of your personal information for purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of personal information; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Exercise Your Rights; Verifying Your Identity</h2>
      <p>
        To exercise any of your privacy rights, or if you have any questions about your privacy rights, you may contact us as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        By Phone at 1800-295-7057
      </p>
      <p>
        By Email at <a href="mailto:info@signtruck.com">info@signtruck.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        After submitting a request, we will take steps to verify your identity in order for us to properly respond and/or confirm that your request is not fraudulent. We may contact you for additional information as reasonably necessary to authenticate your request, but if we are ultimately unable to authenticate your request using reasonable commercial efforts, then we may not be able to comply with it.
        Only you may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you are making a request as the parent or legal guardian of a known child regarding the processing of that child’s personal information, we may ask you to submit reliable proof of your identity.
      </p>

      <h2>Response Time; Your Right to Appeal</h2>
      <p>
        We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, Applicable State Privacy Laws allow us up to 90 days to respond. We will contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to inform you of the need for additional time and the reason for such extension. We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs if your requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.
        If we decline to take action on a request that you have submitted, we will inform you of our reasons for doing so, and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision. You will have the right to appeal within a reasonable period of time after you have received our decision. Within 60 days (45 days for residents of Colorado) of our receipt of your appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If we deny your appeal, we will provide you with a method for contacting your state attorney general’s office to submit a complaint.
